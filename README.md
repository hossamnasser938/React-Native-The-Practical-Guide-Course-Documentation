# React-Native-The-Practical-Guide-Course-Documentation

## Course Overview
This is a great course that walks you through the basics of ` React Native ` that makes you comfortable with that **framework**. 
The great thing about the course is that it **reveals** the issues that you may face when developing using ` React Native `. In the
also you build a real application. I really recommend this course for any one that wants to learn ` React Native `.

## Prerequisites
* JavaScript Basics.
* ES6 Features.
* ` React ` (just the basics is enough).
* ` Redux ` (The instructor will go through that but having prior knowledge will help).
* May be some background in **native** development in **Android** and **IOS** makes you comfortable but it is not a must.

## Course Work
* On the middle of the course I have worked on [` EconomyExam `](https://github.com/hossamnasser938/EconomyExam) application and 
released the 1st version. Currently, after finishing the course I'm working on the 2nd version in the same application.
